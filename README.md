# 💧 Gulp

### 🔍 Description 
Gulp is a CLI-based water reminder that schedules and sends regular water intake reminders, ensuring that the user stays hydrated. It also implements customizable reminder interval and message, as well as startup execution, so the script can run automatically upon login. 

### ⌛ Background
This project was built to address the common issue of forgetting to drink water while using a desktop, especially during long working hours.

### 🔧 Notes 
Enabling or disabling the startup execution feature is currently **unavailable** due to a local environment issue. Please wait for a future fix :)
